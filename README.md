# Movie Booking System App Thing
***TL;DR***: A simple movie booking app made in pure JAVA and packaged UI libraries like JSwing and Java AWT. Stores data in the filesystem within .txt files.   
  
Refer below for more info.  
Probably won't maintain it but I have some stuff I want to change  

### NOTE
`WARNING:` Messy and Duct-taped code  
`TODO:` Fix some stuff if possible

# Why?

# What?
Pure JAVA and packages which come with it. The big ones include java.io, java.swing, java.awt and some other stuff. Used Jetbrains IntelliJ Community for coding the thing and [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) for the minor graphic design as required. Used Google Slides for the Presentation and Git with GitHub for version control. For data management, JAVA filesystem was used as non-JAVA APIs were not allowed and the data was stored in txt files.
